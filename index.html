            <h3 class="section-heading">My Skills</h3>
            <p class="section-text">I mostly focus on back-end development and recently I invested more time in front-end work combined with learning about UI/UX and best practices. Trough my stidues I have encountered a lot of technologies and libraries and I learned how to solve any challenges I face. I like when I'm being challenged and I have to go out of my comfort zone to solve a task. In my opinion the most important skill a Software Engineer can have is problem solving. There is always a new technology developed or a new programming language but the ability of understanding how a problem is solved will always remain the same. Beside my problem solving skills I am also comunicative and a group-oriented person. I can fit quickly in any team and I can collaborate with anyone to achieve a common goal. </p>
            <p class="section-text">I am open minded and I approach any task with a can-do attitude. Not only I can solve a task, I can do it under a stressful situation. </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">My Internship</h3>
            <p class="section-text">During my internship at Altimate S/A I became more responsible for my tasks, and I was a part of 
              a professional enviroment where I adapted good practices and management skills. I got a
              chance to work on the companyâ€™s main solution which oversaw traffic control and monitorization 
              of different events across Romania and other Nordic countries. Through hard work and discipline,
              I implemented features that were used in the development build and improved the user 
              experience.

            <p class="section-text">For fun, I like to watch Formula 1 and other Racing competitions. I tried karting and I loved it everytime even if I'm not that good at it. I've always been a fan of sports. I am regularly going to the gym and doing sports like fotaball whenever I have the chance for health reasons. I pair my strong body with a strong mind by solving different types of puzzles in my free time. </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Bachelor Project - Phone Application</h3>
            <p class="section-text">AroundU is a solution I developed in my Bachelor team, it is a mobile application with the main feature to bring a virtual tour or houses and properties to the user. It is built on a N-tier architecture and it incorporates a lot of technologies. The presentation tier is build with Unity3D and it uses ARCore to take control of camera features. The logic tier that holds all the logic is a NodeJS api that incorporates libraries like ExpressJS, Mongoose ODM and many more to provide all the functionalities needed to manage 360 high quality pictures and other type of data. The storage tier is separated on multiple cloud databases MongoAtlas and Cloudinary. These cloud operating system provide storage for data and high quality images. Aditionally, other cloud services and APIs were used like google cloud functions and geocoder to improve the quality of the system.  </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Virtual Reality Games</h3>
            <p class="section-text">During my last semester I have developed 2 Virtual Reality Games using Unity3D and a pair of Oculus Rift Glasses. One of them is called VirtualDJ, a game where you play the role of a DJ in a Sci-Fi club in space, you pick what songs to play, play with the light effects and access some cool fireworks. The other game is an escape room with the theme being the Chernobyl inspired by the HBO series. In the game you have to solve a puzzle to get access to couple of fuses that can prevent the reactor from exploding. You solve it in time, you save the reactor, you run out of time, you are responsible for the explosion. The game creates preassure on the player with sounds, timer, lightning and other styling elements. </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">FPS Shooter - A Russian Dream</h3>
            <p class="section-text">First person shooter where the character is a russian man dreaming about shooting targets in a sci-fi enviroment. The weapon of chioce is gonna be an AK-47 more specifically a 3D free model with animations from the internet. This project is a combination of free assets from the internet and created assets by me. To build this game I had a journey trough the entire creative pipeline exploring scripting, sound, animation, visual effects, drawing textures, creating 3D models and many more creative activities. The game is simply a timed level where you are supposed to take yourself from start to finish while shooting down all the targets. One of the game mechanics I implemented is wall-running which probably wasn't the best feature I could come up with but it was a fun experience either way. I'm glad to say that my friends and I played this game trying to beat each others times many times and we had great times.</p>
